About the Game
This interactive game highlights the "bullwhip effect" and shows how small fluctuations in demand at the retail level can cause progressively larger fluctuations at the wholesale, distribution, and factory levels.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Play as the Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor, or Factory.

AI Opponents: The other roles in the supply chain are managed by AI players.

Performance Tracking: A real-time chart visualizes your inventory, backlog, and costs.

Geopolitical Effects: Optional "Sanctions" and "Tariffs" can be enabled to simulate real-world supply chain disruptions.

Bilingual Support: The interface is available in both English and Persian (Farsi).

Admin Panel: A password-protected admin area allows for viewing and downloading game reports.
